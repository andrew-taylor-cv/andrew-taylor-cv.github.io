As part of a newly created supply chain function this role encompassed a wide range of activities, and many processes were improved or created by myself to ensure a smooth running of production. I initially joined Woodlands as a supply chain administrator however the role developed further to include procurement and production planning activities.

Administration
Creating PO’s and stock receipts ranging from small ironmongery purchases to large bulk timber purchases ensuring all paperwork is correct for invoicing.
Organising daily transport of timber from docks via third part logistics providers and maintaining correct stock levels on spreadsheets and ERP system.

I then carried out purchasing of consumables based on these stock levels, ensuring production had the required stock.
